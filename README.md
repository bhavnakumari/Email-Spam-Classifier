# Email-Spam-Classifier
The purpose of this project is to use the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm in scikit learn library to predict whether a email is a spam or not, by analysing the body of the email. The data set used in this project is in a compressed tar file. After decompressing the tar file, a email folder should appear which contain text files of around 5000 emails. The accuracy of my model is 92% .
